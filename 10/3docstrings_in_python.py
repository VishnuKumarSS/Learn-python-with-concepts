# docstrings are used to describe the working of the function
# example:
str() # here str() is a function , when we point our cursor to the paranthesis of the function 
# it shows some text . which is the docstring

# the first line after defining the function is the docstring.

# how to define our own docstring to the function
def starz(): # creating function
    "This function does not take any parameters" # this line is the docstring
    # we can use triple quotes to define long description.
starz() # here calling the function, 
# and when we point our cursor to the paranthesis
# of the function is show some text which is the docstring which we have created.
